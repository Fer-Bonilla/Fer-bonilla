<h2 align="center"> Hi there 👋 My name is Fernando</h2>

<p align="center"> I am a Machine Learning and Deep Learning Engineer, working and experimenting with NLP models for text classification and analysis. Humor documents are a funny area for experiments, I am working on it! I am curious about Blockchain and Quantum computing, working and researching in some projects using Solidity for Ethereum and Hyperledger. </p>

### 💼 I’m currently working on
- NLP fiel applied to documents classification! Funny jokes classifications and generation experiments!
- Doing progress with crypto-trading system using predictive models
- Building some Dapps with Solidity for pet’s care fundraising
- Designing some innovative services in the Govtech area, doing government digital services easier and cheaper.

### ⚡ I like to learn new things every day. I am interested in these areas:
-	Artificial Intelligence research oriented in the NLP field. Sentiment and humor detection are interesting areas.
-	Quantum computing applications for Machine Learning.
-	Blockchain Dapps and platforms.

### 👯 I want to collaborate 
with some nice project related to pet’s care, food waste and quality improvement, equality and inclusivity, and environment. If you know about something interesting, I have some time to work on it!
